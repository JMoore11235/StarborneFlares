There is a much more extensive README in the files. This is only so that GitHub would stop bugging me about adding a README.

Note that the .zip folder contains all of the other files, so if you download that, that's all you need.

Also I reference a YouTube video several times, but I haven't done that yet. So you can wait for a while, or read the other readme to get started.




I know that times are hard right now, but I'm running out of fuel for my Starborne Premium. To be clear: THIS IS FREE. ABSOLUTELY. 100%. However, if you feel that #1 you absolutely positively have enough for yourself and loved ones, #2 found this script to be useful and #3 want to support a college student's addiction to video games, I would appreciate even one or two dollars to show your support. If you feel so inclined, here is my PayPal link: [paypal.me/JMoore11235](paypal.me/JMoore11235) 

Donations are greatly appreciated! 



If you have any questions about anything or want to request a feature (no guarentees on that though), feel free to DM me on Discord, JMoney#6100

Stay safe, and enjoy the script!
