There is a much more extensive README in the files. This is only so that GitHub would stop bugging me about adding a README.

Note that the .zip folder contains all of the other files, so if you download that, that's all you need.

Also I reference a YouTube video several times, but I haven't done that yet. So you can wait for a while, or read the other readme to get started.
