There is a much more extensive README in the files. This is only so that GitHub would stop bugging me about adding a README.

Note that the .zip folder contains all of the other files, so if you download that, that's all you need.

Also I reference a YouTube video several times, but I haven't done that yet and probably won't because this became against the rules after I made it. If you're still interested in trying it out anyway (please don't use it more than just to see, though) there's a pretty comprehensive README in there. This most likely doesn't work anymore anyway, since it hasn't been updated in a very long time.
